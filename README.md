# Industrial Manufacturing Service Planning System
üßëüèº‚Äçüè´ This project deals with automated planning in industrial environments, specifically dealing with logistics and robotic agents using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). The primary goal is to model, implement, and solve various planning problems involving robotic agents delivering materials between workstations.

üíª What has been made:

1. **Modelling**<br>
The modelling phase forms the core of the planning process, defining the domain and problem structures using **PDDL**. The **domain file** (Domain.pddl) specifies the types of entities, predicates, and actions available in the system. For example, types include locations, robots, workstations, boxes, and content, while actions like moving robots between locations, picking up and placing boxes, and filling or emptying them are implemented. The **problem file** (Problem.pddl) describe specific instances of the problem, such as the initial setup of objects and the goal conditions. Both simplified and complex instances were tested.

2. **Classical Planning**<br>
Classical planning involves creating a customized planner and heuristic functions to solve specific planning problems. The project implements a **custom planner using the A search algorithm** and defines a **custom heuristic**. The custom heuristic guides the search process by assigning costs to actions based on domain-specific knowledge, incentivizing moves and penalizing actions like emptying boxes in non-optimal locations.
The heuristic plays a crucial role in **optimizing the planner‚Äôs performance**, minimizing computation time and memory usage while ensuring the goals are achieved efficiently.

3. **Temporal Planning & Robotics**<br>
This section extends the planning framework by **integrating temporal planning** and robotic control.

- *Temporal Planning*: Temporal planning introduces **durative actions**, allowing robots to operate within a timeline. This involves synchronizing multiple actions and ensuring that operations are completed in a timely manner.

- *Robotic Planning*: Involves integrating the planning system with **autonomous robotic agents**. The robots are responsible for executing the plans generated by the planner, delivering materials between workstations while optimizing paths and resource usage.

Through these steps, the project demonstrates how combining PDDL-based planning with robotic control can automate and optimize processes in industrial systems.
